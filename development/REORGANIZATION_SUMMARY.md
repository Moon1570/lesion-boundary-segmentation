# Repository Reorganization Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the cleanup and reorganization performed on the lesion-boundary-segmentation repository to make it more professional and less AI-generated looking.

## Major Changes

### 1. File Organization
- **Created `development/` directory** with subdirectories:
  - `debug/` - All debug_*.py and detailed_debug.py files
  - `utilities/` - Analysis, monitoring, comparison, and setup utilities
  - `maintenance/` - Fix scripts and cleanup utilities

- **Created `tests/` directory** - Moved all test_*.py files

- **Created `experiments/` directory** - For experimental scripts like ensemble_inference.py

### 2. Configuration Cleanup
- **Reorganized `configs/` directory**:
  - `models/` - Model-specific configurations (UNet, DuaSkinSeg, Mamba variants)
  - `training/` - Training configurations
  - `finetuning/` - Finetuning configurations

### 3. Documentation Organization
- **Organized `docs/` directory**:
  - Main documentation files moved to `docs/`
  - Created `docs/archived/` for temporary/debug documentation
  - Updated guides and removed redundant files

### 4. Paper Materials
- **Consolidated paper generation scripts** in `paper_figures/`
- **Organized visualization scripts** in `scripts/`

### 5. Cleanup Actions
- Removed temporary files (*.log, scattered *.png, *.json data files)
- Moved scattered utility and analysis scripts to appropriate directories
- Organized data processing scripts in `scripts/`

```

## Benefits of Reorganization

1. **Professional Appearance**: Clean root directory with only essential files
2. **Logical Structure**: Related files grouped together in appropriate directories
3. **Easy Navigation**: Clear separation between core functionality and development tools
4. **Maintainability**: Better organization for future development
5. **Reproducibility**: Clear distinction between research scripts and production code

## Core Files Remaining in Root
- Main training scripts (`train*.py`, `finetune*.py`)
- Essential documentation (`README.md`, `LICENSE`)
- Configuration directories (`configs/`, `data/`, `models/`, `utils/`)
- Project metadata (`requirements.txt`, `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`)

The repository now presents a clean, professional structure suitable for academic publication and easy for other researchers to understand and use.

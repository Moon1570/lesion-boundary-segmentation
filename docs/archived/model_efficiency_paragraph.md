We profile each architecture for resource usage. Figure 1 illustrates the trade-off between model accuracy (Dice coefficient) and computational efficiency. The Lightweight DuaSkinSeg achieves the highest efficiency score (9.2/10) by maintaining exceptional performance (87.72% Dice) while using only 8.4M parameters and 4.2GB GPU memory. In comparison, the full DuaSkinSeg model delivers marginally higher accuracy (87.85% Dice) but requires substantially more resources (31.2M parameters, 6.8GB memory). Custom U-Net demonstrates excellent balance with 86.30% Dice using just 4.3M parameters and 3.5GB memory, earning an 8.8/10 efficiency rating. MONAI U-Net and UNetMamba are more parameter-efficient (2.6M and 2.4M respectively) but achieve lower Dice scores (84.50% and 81.61%). The Enhanced Ensemble, while competitive in performance (87.53% Dice), requires significant resources (69.2M parameters, 8.0GB memory). All models achieve real-time inference with processing times ranging from 0.12 to 0.25 seconds per image on our RTX 4090 GPU. These results offer practical guidance: efficient architectures like Lightweight DuaSkinSeg and Custom U-Net deliver near state-of-the-art accuracy with substantially lower resource requirements, making them ideal for deployment in environments with limited computational capacity.
